# generative-ai-projects
A learning and experimentation repository for generative AI projects and techniques. This repo explores Transformer Architecture, Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Vector Databases with practical code, tutorials, and resources.

# Generative AI Projects and Learning Repository

This repository contains my generative AI projects, tutorials, and resources as I explore various models and techniques in the field. The aim is to document my learning journey, experiment with state-of-the-art tools, and develop a portfolio of projects.

  ### [Project 1: Streamlit-Powered Generative AI Assistant with LangChain on Local Machine](https://github.com/Thomas-K-John/generative-ai-projects/tree/main/projects/ai_assistant_with_langchain_on_local_machine)
  ### [Project 2: AWS AI Code Generator with Bedrock, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and Terraform](projects/aws_bedrock_code_generator)
  ### [Project 3: Agentic AI Text-to-Speech Assistant (Bedrock, Polly, Strands Agents)](projects/text_to_speech_agent)
