# generative-ai-projects
A learning and experimentation repository for generative AI projects and techniques. This repo explores Transformer Architecture, Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Vector Databases with practical code, tutorials, and resources.

# Generative AI Projects and Learning Repository

This repository contains my generative AI projects, tutorials, and resources as I explore various models and techniques in the field. The aim is to document my learning journey, experiment with state-of-the-art tools, and develop a portfolio of projects.

## Repository Structure
- **`projects/`** - Individual projects with code, data, and results.
- **`resources/`** - Research papers, articles, and other references.
- **`tutorials/`** - Jupyter notebooks and scripts covering techniques and concepts.
- **`scripts/`** - Reusable scripts for data preprocessing, evaluation, and other utilities.

## Key Areas of Focus
1. **Transformer Architecture**
2. **Prompt Engineering**
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
4. **Vector Databases**

Feel free to clone this repository and explore my projects or contribute if you'd like!
