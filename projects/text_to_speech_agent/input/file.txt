India is well-known for its rich culture, traditions, mythological stories, and religious diversity worldwide. Stories like Ramayana are prevalent in the sensibilities of Indian people and play a vital role in preaching the overall ideal way of living in the world. It is an epic that strengthens the importance of brotherhood, sacrifices for loved ones, a sense of righteousness, culture, humbleness, and simple living with a touch of sacredness. Ramayana is much more than a mythological tale that teaches us about our heritage and some of history’s most significant events. Children should be taught these stories from an early age since it helps them understand Indian history much better. The Ramayana story in English is taught in many elementary schools as part of the curriculum. The Ramayana’s full story is of prince Rama’s journey with the help of an army of monkeys to rescue his beloved wife, Sita, from the hands of the great monarch of Lanka, Ravana.
